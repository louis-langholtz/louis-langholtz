- 👋 Hi, I’m Louis Langholtz (@louis-langholtz).
- 👀 I’m interested in motivation theory based approaches to software, business, leadership, and interpersonal relationships.
- Besides enjoying software development in languages like C++, I like a variety of physical activities and immersive D&D-like role playing games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the human experience... every day of my life, haha! I'd like to think of myself as a proverbial old dog that's still learning new tricks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software or business projects.
- I'm also on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7410358/louis-langholtz), other StackExchange sites like [Software Engineering](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/263631/louis-langholtz), and some other social networking sites.
- I'm outspoken about some things:
  - [C++: Please Don't Use std::endl!](https://gist.github.com/louis-langholtz/9959fbc735a23b631e7d795d4eb0839f).
  - [C++: My Love Affair With Polymorphic Value Types](https://gist.github.com/louis-langholtz/5da900c8333eed26641a09bea7aa5c31).
  - [C++ private member functions aren't necessary](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/430111), consider non-member non-friend functions instead.
- 📫 How to reach me: leave a comment near something I've said or done that you're more interested in. Hopefully that weeds out the bots and leaves the people who have more sincere interest in contacting me. 😉
